A microcomputing box

Prototype #1
------------

Leaves out the wireless communications aspect. Also not pretty.
Goal is to nail down the interfacing with Node.js and the firmware.

Prototype #2
------------

Prettified Prototype #1. Adds bluetooth connectivity (simply swap in a serial module - no code change).
